# hello-world
This is my first time creating a repository and learning github

Hello to al the people reading this, maybe there is nobody reading it but me and that's enough because i've taken the decision of learning coding to have the best life I might be able to live, I'm from Colombia, a country located in south america on top of it actually, I'm 17 years old, about to finish 11th grade which is the last grade in school in my country and I'm a little bit sad because I don't want to leave my school, I feel like I'm not prepared for life right now and I'm dealing with all the family and school stuff that it carries on.

I've encouraged myself to learn coding because I have liked technology since I remember and I've been using my computer every single day since I got one.
